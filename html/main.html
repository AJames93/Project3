  <p>This website uses data,  in part,  from (source) looking at various restaurant reviews across 5 states. The original data consisted of over 2500 restaurants across 20 cities in California, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Washington. We shortened the data to the top 20 of each based on their review scores and number of reviews.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="center">
  Information you can find about the locations include the name of the restaurant, the location, the main type of cuisine, the review ratings, and the number of reviews.
</div>
<br>
<div class="center">
  First we looked at the top 10 restaurant types among the 100 locations. We represented this information in a pie chart. American cuisine holds the majority with 51.2% and Italian with 19.5%. We recreated this pie chart for each state to see how this changed

<p>Comparing all five states, we calculated the weighted average for each. This is displayed on the bar chart directly below. This resulted in California with the highest weighted average rating on 4.54 and Texas with 4.51. A notability tight spread. This is highly due to the fact that we chose to look at the top 20 restaurants for each state.</p>

  <p>Wondering how well we could trust these numbers, and a bit of Texas Pride, we also looked at the number of reviews. Considering that New York had 27,256 reviews, we feel more confident that the weighted average rating of 4.52 is a fairly accurate rating. On the flip side, New Jersey with only 9,051 reviews makes us doubt the rating of 4.54. Texas, being very opinionated with 23,844 reviews, shows that Texans like to leave reviews and may be a bit picky on their restaurant ratings.</p>
